# Bootstrap Project

Set up agent context files so Claude Code, Codex, and other AI agents understand a project from the first prompt.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when the user:

- Wants to start a new project with agent context from the beginning
- Opens an existing repo that lacks `AGENTS.md`
- Says "bootstrap this project", "set up agent context", or similar
- Asks for help creating `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`

## Steps

### 1. Determine whether this is a new or existing project

**Existing project** — the current directory has source files, a README, or a `.git` directory:
- Skip to step 3.

**New project** — the current directory is not a project, or the user wants to create one:
- Ask for:
  1. **Project name** — used for the directory name (kebab-case, e.g. `my-project`) and the `AGENTS.md` heading.
  2. **Location** — parent directory (default: current directory).
  3. **Brief description** — purpose, intended stack, key constraints. This replaces file-based inference in step 3.
- Create the directory: `mkdir -p <location>/<project-name>`
- `cd` into it.
- Run `git init`.
- Create a `.gitignore` appropriate for the described stack (e.g. Node, Python, Rust).

### 2. Guard against overwrites

- If `AGENTS.md` already exists, **stop and ask** before overwriting.
- If `CLAUDE.md` exists and is **not** a symlink to `AGENTS.md`, **stop and ask**.
- If `agent_docs/` already exists, skip creating it but mention it.

### 3. Gather project context

Read (do **not** modify) the following if they exist:

- `README.md` / `README`
- `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, or equivalent manifest
- Top-level directory listing (one level deep)
- CI config (`.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Makefile`, `Justfile`, etc.)

For new projects with no files, use the user's description from step 1 instead.

### 4. Write `AGENTS.md`

Create `AGENTS.md` in the project root. Use the structure below as a guide — fill every section with specifics from step 3. **Omit sections that don't apply.** Never leave placeholder text or angle-bracket tokens in the output.

**Structure:**

- **Heading** — project name.
- **Opening line** — one-sentence purpose.
- **Stack** — language, framework, major dependencies.
- **Directory Structure** — table of key paths and their purpose.
- **Key Commands** — build, test, lint/format, dev server (only those that exist).
- **Conventions** — coding style, naming, branching model, PR process.
- **Gotchas** — non-obvious things an agent should know (env vars, generated files, monorepo quirks, etc.).

### 5. Create `CLAUDE.md` symlink

```bash
ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
```

Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` for project instructions. The symlink keeps `AGENTS.md` as the single source of truth. Codex reads `AGENTS.md` directly — no extra symlink needed.

### 6. Create `agent_docs/` directory

```bash
mkdir -p agent_docs
```

Add `agent_docs/README.md` so the directory is tracked by git:

```markdown
# agent_docs

Supplementary context for AI agents working in this repository.
Place architecture decisions, API specs, or onboarding notes here.
```

### 7. Report results

Print a summary of what was created:

```
Created:
  AGENTS.md          — project context for AI agents
  CLAUDE.md          -> AGENTS.md (symlink)
  agent_docs/        — supplementary context directory

Next steps:
  - Review AGENTS.md and refine any sections
  - Add architecture docs or API specs to agent_docs/
  - Commit the new files
```
